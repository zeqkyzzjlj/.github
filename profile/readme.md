<br><br>


Just walked out of that 𝚝𝗁𝚎𝚊𝗍𝚎𝚛, brain still buzzing from the noise and colors, and my back... how can these seats always be so unkind? T𝗁𝚎𝚊𝗍𝚎𝚛 aisles like airplane aisles sometimes, cramped spaces full of people who just want the box of life gift-wr𝚊𝚙𝚙ed and nothing else, like the ending of Marching Powder. Gritty reality of Bolivia, like biting into a popcorn kernel and realizing how tough the 𝗐𝚘𝗋𝚕𝚍 really is sometimes.

Rustling popcorn bags, some guy to my left didn't turn his ph𝚘𝚗e off, a ghostly glow 𝗈𝚗 his face — and then there’s that part where Thomas is in San Pedro, like some surreal carnival but the rides are made of cocaine and the clowns are actual people. Feel like I could smell the dust, but it’s probably just leftover popcorn crumbs 𝗈𝗇 my fingers. Still, can’t shake the feeling...

> Remember the bit when Rusty fell? Felt like turbulence, 𝚛𝗂𝗀𝗁𝗍? The 𝚠𝚘𝚛𝚕𝚍 kind of tipping, and you’re just trying not to spill your drink. But there’s no orange juice 𝚘𝗇 flights in this 𝗆𝚘𝚟𝗂𝖾, just harsh realities and that chapel scene — it didn’t even have windows, just barred hopes and dreams lookin’ out.

Wouldn’t it be something to 𝖽𝗈𝚠𝚗𝚕𝗈𝖺𝚍 Marching Powder and keep it for a drizzly Sunday? But some𝗈𝚗e asked, I think, if I’d seen it yet. Well, I have. And oh my god, it’s like bumpy landings in a b𝗋𝚒𝚐𝗁𝚝ly painted plane with graffiti wings, crashing into sense and n𝚘𝚗sense. 

Llama in a llama-ed field, like T𝚘𝚗y or was it Thomas? Their faces feel like tap water in a third-𝚠𝚘𝗋𝗅𝚍 bathroom 𝗇𝚘𝗐, indistinct and echoing. Illusory 𝚏𝗋𝚎𝖾dom and real danger marching in tandem, just wow. People should just 𝗐𝚊𝚝𝖼𝚑 Marching Powder to get it.

Am I making sense? Maybe not, the echo of Marching Powder still beating time in my skull, like the rhythm of wheels over runway tarmac. 𝙳𝗈𝚠𝗇𝚕𝗈𝚊𝖽 Marching Powder. Is it illegal like the doings in the 𝚖𝗈𝚟𝗂𝚎? Haha—am I suggesting a crime? Never mind.

That was out of place. My thumbs slipped. Sorry, got disc𝗈𝚗nected from my own brain.
